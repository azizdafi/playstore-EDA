* Android is expanding as an operating system. It has captured around 74% of the total market which is a true indicator of the huge amount of population using android. Our goal is to help android developers to know what is the motivating factor for people to download an app. It will also help to find out the factors that affect someoneâ€™s decision to download an app. I would like to analyse category, reviews, price, ratings and installs for this purpose and find out how they are inter related.

There have some Problem Statements that are very useful for finding the insight from given Dataset -

* Which category has most number of installations.
* Top 5 app with the maximum installation.
* Top 5 poor app in refrence of instaallation.
* How Rating is important for Application.
* Top Category on Play Store.
* Find number of app in refrence of Free or Paid.
